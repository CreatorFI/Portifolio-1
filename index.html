            <p> I was always passionate about technologies. I wanted to be in this tech sector since I was 13. I wanted To Create Software, To be a part of the Internet World. So My first step was Web Development. I read books, practised. Even though, there was very slow Internet in our area, I never gave up. I took a course afterwise and Here I am today. Now I'm also a part of a great writing community in which I started with Tech-writing. I never stopped believing as well as never stopped learning. </p>
